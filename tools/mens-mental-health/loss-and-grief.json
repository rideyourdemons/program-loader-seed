The mechanism involves redirecting your attention from the internal narrative that's running on repeat to external sensory input or structured action. This shift creates space for your system to access different response options.

This technique helps you identify and act on one trait or quality from the person or situation you've lost that you respect or want to carry forward.

      "how_it_works": "Uses cognitive externalization to map the 'voids' left by loss, preventing the mind from falling into recursive loops and allowing for structured processing of the new reality. When you're processing significant loss, your mind can get stuck in loops of what's gone, what's missing, and what can never be again. This tactic works by forcing you to externalize the impact of the loss onto paper or screen, creating distance between the experience and your processing of it. The mapping process helps you see patterns in how the loss has affected your daily structure, routines, and sense of stability. By identifying what remains unchanged and using that as an anchor, you're creating a foundation for your nervous system to recalibrate around. This isn't about moving on or getting over it, but rather creating enough structural stability that you can process the loss without your entire system collapsing.",

This approach draws from grief processing frameworks used in contexts where people need to maintain function while processing significant loss.
