When you're stuck in reactive patterns, your system defaults to familiar pathways that may no longer serve you. This tactic works by creating an intentional interruption in those automatic loops, giving your system a chance to recalibrate. The mechanism involves redirecting your attention from the internal narrative that's running on repeat to external sensory input or structured action. This shift creates space for your system to access different response options. It's not about forcing a change through willpower, but rather creating the conditions where your body and mind can naturally access more adaptive patterns.",

This approach draws from evidence-based frameworks around pattern interruption, stress response regulation, and behavioral activation.
