      "action": "Grounding: Inhale deeply through nose, add a second short sharp inhale, then a long slow exhale through mouth. Repeat 3 times. This breathing technique works by activating your body's natural calming response. When you're in a state of stress, your nervous system is in fight-or-flight mode. The double inhale followed by a long exhale triggers the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps slow your heart rate and calm your body. It's a quick way to interrupt the stress response and create space for clearer thinking.",

      "how_it_works": "Leverages psychological mechanics to disrupt old loops and install new tactical responses. When you're stuck in reactive patterns, your nervous system defaults to familiar pathways that may no longer serve you. This tactic works by creating an intentional interruption in those automatic loops, giving your system a chance to recalibrate. The mechanism involves redirecting your attention from the internal narrative that's running on repeat to external sensory input or structured action. This shift creates space for your system to access different response options. It's not about forcing a change through willpower, but rather creating the conditions where your body and mind can naturally access more adaptive patterns. The psychological mechanics here involve pattern interruption, attention redirection, and creating new neural pathways through repeated tactical practice.",
      "where_it_came_from": "Grounded in behavioral psychology, adapted for the real-world fight. This approach draws from evidence-based frameworks around pattern interruption, stress response regulation, and behavioral activation. The specific mechanics have been tested in both clinical settings and lived experience of what actually works when someone is in the middle of struggling. Rather than requiring extensive preparation or theoretical understanding, this has been distilled down to tactical responses you can deploy in the moment. It combines principles from cognitive reframing, somatic regulation techniques, and practical stress management, but presented as actionable tactics rather than abstract concepts.",

When you're running on fumes, it's often because you're spending energy on things that drain rather than sustain you. This technique helps you identify energy leaks by reviewing your last 48 hours and labeling tasks as either charging or draining.

      "how_it_works": "Uses cognitive load mapping to identify 'parasitic drains' on mental bandwidth, allowing for a strategic reallocation of focus. When you're running on fumes, your system is often being depleted by tasks and commitments that don't serve your core objectives. This tactic works by forcing you to audit where your energy actually goes, then making conscious decisions about what to eliminate. The cognitive load mapping creates visibility into patterns you might not notice when you're in autopilot mode. By identifying zero-ROI drains and executing blackouts on non-essential inputs, you're creating space for your system to recover and redirect energy toward what actually matters.",
      "where_it_came_from": "Adapted from industrial organizational psychology and simplified for high-stakes individual endurance. This approach draws from workload analysis frameworks used in high-performance environments where mental bandwidth is a critical resource. The specific mechanics have been tested in both corporate settings dealing with burnout and individual contexts where people need to maintain performance under sustained pressure. Rather than requiring complex systems or extensive tracking, this has been distilled down to a tactical audit you can run in real-time when you notice your energy reserves depleting.",
