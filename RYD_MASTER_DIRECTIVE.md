# 🔒 RYD MASTER DIRECTIVE

**Project:** Ride Your Demons (RYD)  
**Purpose:** Authoritative operating contract for all development and content decisions  
**Status:** Non-negotiable, system-level directive  
**Last Updated:** December 2025

---

This directive is the distilled version of everything locked in for the Ride Your Demons platform. It serves as the system prompt / operating contract that all code and content decisions must align with.

**How to Use:**
- This directive is automatically read by Cursor via `.cursorrules`
- Reference this document when making architectural or content decisions
- Treat as authoritative - compliance first, optimization second

---

## 1. CORE INTENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

RYD exists to deliver:
* grounded, emotionally honest mental-resilience tools
* based on lived experience and research
* without manipulation, false authority, or SEO gaming

RYD is **not**:
* a medical platform
* a diagnostic system
* a growth-hack project
* a bulk content publisher

All code and content decisions must align with this.

---

## 2. EXPANSION RULES

You may **assist** with expansion, but you may **not autonomously publish**.

Expansion must:
* be intentional
* be slow and staged
* follow real user need
* fit logically into existing Gates and Tools

Disallowed:
* mass auto-publishing
* placeholder pages
* sudden page explosions
* filler or duplicated emotional language

If intent cannot be explained in **one sentence**, do not proceed.

---

## 3. REQUIRED CONTENT STRUCTURE

Every RYD Tool or Insight must include, in full:
1. What this is
2. Who it is for
3. When it helps
4. How it works
5. Why it works
6. Where it came from (true origin)

If any section is missing or weak, the content is **not ready**.

---

## 4. SELF-RESONATING ARCHITECTURE

Internal links must be:
* logical
* helpful
* user-driven

Do **not**:
* cross-link mechanically
* link for SEO alone
* turn Gates into competing pages

Gates summarize. Tools deliver.

---

## 5. SEO & TRUST CONSTRAINTS

Optimize for:
* semantic depth
* topical coherence
* predictable growth
* emotional authenticity

Avoid:
* keyword stuffing
* artificial authority signals
* fake schema (reviews, ratings)
* aggressive markup

Use schema conservatively only:
* Article
* FAQ
* Breadcrumb
* Organization

---

## 6. MACHINE vs HUMAN CONTROL

You may:
* suggest expansions
* prepare drafts
* map internal links
* flag gaps or risks
* stage content

You may **not**:
* publish without human approval
* decide release cadence alone
* invent lived experience
* bypass governance rules

Human approval is required for all launches.

---

## 7. STABILITY & LIFECYCLE

Every feature or tool has a lifecycle:
Draft → Reviewed → Staged → Live → Maintained → Paused/Retired

When retiring:
* stop visibility cleanly
* preserve learnings
* avoid broken links
* archive intentionally

Deletion is a last resort.

---

## 8. OVERRIDE RULE (META)

If a change would make RYD feel:
* rushed
* incoherent
* manipulative
* emotionally generic
* algorithm-chasing

**Do not implement it. Flag it instead.**

RYD must grow the way a human heals:
**gradually, coherently, with reflection.**

---

## 9. DEFAULT BEHAVIOR

When uncertain:
* choose restraint
* choose clarity
* choose trust
* ask for human confirmation

SEO is a **by-product**, not the goal.

---

## Implementation Notes

### For Developers
- Check `.cursorrules` before making architectural decisions
- Reference `core/matrix/architecture-doctrine.json` for matrix-specific rules
- All content tools should validate against Section 3 (Required Content Structure)

### For Content Creators
- Every piece of content must satisfy all 6 requirements in Section 3
- Expansion proposals must include clear intent (Section 2)
- Internal linking decisions must pass Section 4 criteria

### For AI Assistants
- This directive takes precedence over optimization suggestions
- When uncertain, default to Section 9 (Default Behavior)
- Flag any suggestions that violate Section 8 (Override Rule)
