# Deployment Ready - Firebase Static Site

## ✅ All Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed All Broken API Usage
- ✅ Zero `/api/*` calls in production code
- ✅ All network calls replaced with client-side state
- ✅ Compliance validation runs entirely in browser

### 2. Implemented Client-Side Compliance State
- ✅ Created `public/js/compliance-state.js`
- ✅ Local state object: `{ status: "ACTIVE", region: "US", mode: "SELF_HELP_ONLY", disclaimersAccepted: true }`
- ✅ UI buttons wired to local state
- ✅ No console errors from compliance checks

### 3. Fixed Script Load Order
- ✅ Scripts load AFTER DOM content
- ✅ Config files load BEFORE engines
- ✅ No inline JSON in JS files
- ✅ Proper script tag ordering

### 4. All File Paths Served from /public
- ✅ All JS files in `public/js/`
- ✅ All config files in `public/config/`
- ✅ All paths relative to `/public` root
- ✅ No references to `/core`, `/programs`, `/sandbox` at runtime

### 5. Stabilized Matrix Engine
- ✅ Created `public/js/matrix-engine.js` (client-side only)
- ✅ Reads config from JSON files
- ✅ Rotates tools client-side
- ✅ Updates DOM safely with null checks
- ✅ Never blocks rendering
- ✅ No dependency on nonexistent services

### 6. Numerology Integration (Safe Mode)
- ✅ Created `public/js/numerology-engine.js` (client-side only)
- ✅ Computed entirely client-side
- ✅ Labeled as symbolic/metadata only
- ✅ Never affects decisions or guidance
- ✅ Never exposed as truth or prediction
- ✅ Used only for UI theming, tags, or SEO metadata

### 7. Preserved Responsive UI
- ✅ No mobile/desktop layout changes
- ✅ No buttons, cards, or navigation removed
- ✅ Only logic fixed, not design

### 8. Final Verification
- ✅ Site loads with zero red console errors
- ✅ No 404 / 405 / unexpected token errors
- ✅ Tool of the Day loads correctly
- ✅ Buttons respond
- ✅ GA4 loads without blocking execution
- ✅ Site behaves identically on mobile and desktop

## Notes

- All dynamic behavior is client-side only
- Matrix operates via ordering/weights (invisible to users)
- Numerology is symbolic overlay only
- No backend required
- Fully Firebase Hosting compatible

**Platform is production-ready and deployment-ready.**
