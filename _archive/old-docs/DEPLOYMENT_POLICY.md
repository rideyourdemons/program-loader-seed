# 🔒 DEPLOYMENT POLICY - STRICT APPROVAL REQUIRED

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: NO DEPLOYMENTS WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL

**This is a hard requirement: Nothing gets deployed to production/live without explicit approval.**

---

## ✅ Current Status: SAFE - NO DEPLOYMENTS

### What We've Done:
- ✅ **Local Development Only** - All work done locally
- ✅ **Sandbox Testing** - All testing in local sandbox (localhost:3001, 3003)
- ✅ **File Copies** - Engines copied to RYD Site folder (local files only)
- ✅ **No Live Changes** - Nothing deployed to rideyourdemons.com
- ✅ **No Auto-Deploy** - No automated deployment scripts active

### All Changes Are:
- 📁 **Local files only** - On your computer
- 🧪 **Testing environments** - Sandbox servers (localhost)
- 📋 **Development work** - Not production code
- 🔒 **Safe to test** - Can't affect live site

---

## 🛡️ Deployment Protection

### Current Safeguards:
1. ✅ **Read-Only Mode** - System has read-only protections
2. ✅ **Approval System** - Built-in approval workflows (not active for live)
3. ✅ **Sandbox Testing** - All testing isolated to sandbox
4. ✅ **No Deployment Scripts** - No automatic deployment configured
5. ✅ **Manual Process Required** - Everything requires manual action

### To Deploy (When Ready):
1. ✅ **Test in sandbox first** (required)
2. ✅ **Get explicit approval** (required)
3. ✅ **Manual deployment process** (required)
4. ✅ **Review changes** (required)
5. ✅ **Confirm deployment** (required)

## 📋 What Happens Next

### When You're Ready to Deploy:
1. **You must explicitly request deployment**
2. **We review what will be deployed**
3. **You approve each step**
4. **Deployment happens manually with your oversight**
5. **Nothing automatic happens**

### Current State:
- ✅ All code is local
- ✅ All testing is in sandbox
- ✅ All engines are integrated locally
- ✅ Nothing is live
- ✅ Nothing will go live without your approval
