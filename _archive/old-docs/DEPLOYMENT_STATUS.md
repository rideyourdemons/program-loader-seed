## ✅ Current Status

### Sandbox Environment (Testing - OK to Deploy Here)

- ✅ **This is where all work happens**

### Production Site (Never Touch)
- ❌ **NEVER DEPLOYED TO** - rideyourdemons.com is NEVER touched

## 📍 Where Everything Lives

```
Your Computer:
└── Documents/
    └── program-loader-seed_MATRIX_COMPLETE_2025-12-26/
        └── program-loader-seed/          ← ALL CODE HERE
            ├── core/                     ← Engines
            ├── sandbox-preview/          ← Testing
            ├── docs/                     ← Documentation
            └── platform-integrated.html  ← Demo/Test file

Production Site (UNCHANGED):
└── rideyourdemons.com                    ← NOT TOUCHED
    └── Your React app                    ← NOT MODIFIED
```

## 🧪 Testing Only

Everything you see is:
- ✅ **Local development** - On your computer only
- ✅ **Sandbox testing** - Testing environment
- ✅ **No deployment** - Nothing pushed to production
- ✅ **Safe to experiment** - Can't break anything

---

## 🚀 If You Want to Deploy (Later)

When you're ready (if ever), you would:

1. **Copy code** from `program-loader-seed/core/` to your RYD React app
2. **Integrate** into React components
3. **Test** locally with React
4. **You deploy** to production (your decision, your control)

**But for now:**
- ✅ Everything is safe in development
- ✅ Nothing has been deployed
- ✅ Nothing will be deployed without your explicit instruction
- ✅ You have full control

---

## ✅ Confirmation

**Nothing has been deployed. Everything is local development only.**

Your production site at rideyourdemons.com is completely safe and unchanged.
